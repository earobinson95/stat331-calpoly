#### **Student's Weekly Reflection Journal for Statistical Computing**

------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Week 1: 1/7 - 1/13**

**1. Function Log:**

- Function: `sum()`
  - Purpose: This function calculates the sum of the elements in a numeric vector.
  - Example: `sum(c(1, 2, 3, 4))` returns 10.

- Function: `mean()`
  - Purpose: This function computes the arithmetic mean of a numeric vector.
  - Example: `mean(c(2, 4, 6, 8))` returns 5.

**2. Error Diary:**
- Error Encountered: "Error in sum(x, y) : argument 'y' is missing, with no default"
  - Issue Description: I tried to calculate the sum of two vectors but forgot to combine them into one vector.
  - Resolution: I realized I should use `c()` to combine the elements into a single vector. Corrected it to `sum(c(x, y))`.

- Error Encountered: "Error: object 'num_vec' not found"
  - Issue Description: I attempted to calculate the mean of a vector but mistyped the vector name.
  - Resolution: After checking, I found the correct name of the vector and corrected the typo.

**3. Reflection:**

- This Week's Learning: I've learned the importance of vector operations in R and how simple functions like `sum()` and `mean()` are fundamental in data analysis. I also realized the significance of accurate typing and syntax in R.
- Challenges: The primary challenge was getting familiar with R syntax and understanding error messages. Initially, the error messages were confusing, but I'm starting to understand how they guide towards the problem.
- Future Applications: Understanding these basic functions lays the groundwork for more complex data analysis tasks. I plan to apply this knowledge in upcoming projects where data summarization is necessary.
