A frequently used measurement for fish health is a "condition index." [(Wikipedia article)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_index_in_fish) The following simple equation can be used to calculate the approximate condition index of a fish:

$$\text{condition index} = \frac{weight}{length^3} \times 100$$

**1. There are specific units required for the calculation of a condition index. Length must be in millimeters, and weight must be in grams. Inspect the `length` and `weight` variables to decide if you believe these are the correct units associated with these measurements.**

:::callout-tip
This will likely require Googling what "typical" measurements of trout are.
:::

```{r}
# Question 1 code
```

**2. Replace impossible measurements with `NA`s -- Based on your research, write function(s) to handle the unlikely / impossible measurements included in the data set.**

Your function(s) should accept three inputs 

+ a vector of measurements,
+ the minimum value you believe is "reasonable,"
+ the maximum value you believe is "reasonable." 

If a value falls outside these bounds, you should replace it with an `NA`.

::: callout-tip
If you are struggling with the structure of your function, I would suggest reading the [Mutating Function](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html#mutate-functions) from R4DS.
:::

Use your function to modify the `length` and `weight` columns of the `BlackfootFish` data set, removing values you believe are "unreasonable."

```{r}
# Question 2 code
```

**3. Write a function which calculates the condition index of a fish, given inputs of weight and length.**

::: callout-warning
Consider whether your function will accept vectors as inputs or if it will accept variable names as inputs!
:::

```{r}
# Question 3 code
```

**4. Make a thoughtful visualization of how fish conditions have varied over the duration of this study.**

```{r}
# Question 4 code
