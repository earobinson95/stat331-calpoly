The goal of this lab is learn more about exploring missing data and to teach you to write modular code.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

fish_data <- read.csv()
```

## Data Set

This lab's data set concerns mark-recapture data on fish from the Blackfoot River, outside of Helena, Montana.

![](https://github.com/earobinson95/stat331-calpoly/blob/master/lab-assignments/lab7/images/blackfoot_river.jpg?raw=true)

Mark-recapture is a common method used by Ecologists to estimate an animal population's size, when it is impossible to conduct a census (count every animal). This method works by "tagging" animals with a tracking device, so scientists can track their movement and / or presence.

## Data Exploration

The measurements of each fish captured were taken by a Biologist on a raft. This lack of "laboratory setting" opens the door to the possibility of measurement errors.

#### 1. Summarizing the Data

Output **ONE** table to answer the following two questions:

+ How many observations have missing values?
+ What variable(s) have missing values present?

::: callout-tip
Hint: use `across()`
:::

```{r}
# Question 1 code
```

Unfortunately, these missing values are not for only one `year`, `trip`, or `section` of river.

#### 2. Visualizing the Data

Create a thoughtful visualization exploring the frequency of missing values across the different years, sections, and trips.

```{r}
# Question 2 code
```

## Function Writing: Adjusting the Data

If I wanted to rescale every quantitative variable in my data set so that the variables have values between 0 and 1. I could use the following formula:

</br>

$$y_{scaled} = \frac{y_i - min\{y_1, y_2,..., y_n\}}{max\{y_1, y_2,..., y_n\} 
- min\{y_1, y_2,..., y_n\}}$$

</br>

The following `R` code would carry out this rescaling procedure for the `length` and `weight` columns of the data:

\vspace{0.25cm}

```{r}
#| eval: false

fish_data <- fish_data |> 
  mutate(length = (length - min(length, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
           (max(length, na.rm = TRUE) - min(length)), 
         weight = (weight - min(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
           (max(weight, na.rm = TRUE) - min(length, na.rm = TRUE))
         )
```

This process of duplicating an action multiple times makes it difficult to understand the intent of the process. Additionally, it makes it very difficult to spot the mistakes. *Did you spot the mistake in the weight conversion?*

Often you will find yourself in the position of needing to find a function that performs a specific task, but you do not know of a function or a library that would help you. You could spend time Googling for a solution, but in the amount of time it takes you to find something you could have already written your own function!

#### 3. Writing a Function

Let's transform the repeated process above into a `rescale_01()` function.

-   The function should take a single vector as its input.
-   The function should return the rescaled vector.

::: callout-tip
Think about the "efficiency" of your function. Are you calling the **same** function multiple times?

Hint: Look into the function `range()`
:::

```{r}
rescale_01 <- function(x){
  
  # Question 3 & 4 code

}
```

#### 4. Adding Stops

Now, let's incorporate some checks into your function! Modify your previous code to create the following checks:

-   the function should stop if the input vector is not numeric
-   the function should stop if the length of the vector is not greater than 1

::: callout-tip
No need to write code here, simply add these stops to your funciton code above!
:::

#### 5. Performing a Simple Test

Run the code below to test your function on the simple vector below. Verify that the maximum of your rescaled vector is 1 and the minimum is 0!

```{r}
x <- c(1:25, NA)

rescaled <- rescale_01(x)
min(rescaled, na.rm = TRUE)
max(rescaled, na.rm = TRUE)
```

#### 6. Performing a More Difficult Test

Next, let's test the function on the `length` column of the `BlackfootFish` data set.

The code below makes a histogram of the original values of `length`. Add a plot of the rescaled values of `length`. Output your plots side-by-side horizontally, so the reader can confirm the only aspect that has changed is the scale.

::: callout-warning
This will require you call your `rescaled_01()` function within a `mutate()` statement in order to create a new `length_scaled` variable.
:::

::: callout-tip
There are multiple methods and packages that allow you to put plots side by side. One of my favorite for ggplot is the {patchwork} R package. You might also look into the code-chunk options `#| layout-ncol:`

:::

```{r}
original_plot <- fish |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = length)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 45) +
  labs(x = "Original Values of Fish Length (mm)")

scaled_plot <- # Question 6 plot code
  
# Either code to output plots side by side or include code chunk option at the top of this code chunk.
```

#### 7. Incorportaing Variables

Suppose you would like for your `rescale()` function to perform operations on a variable within a data set. Ideally, your function would take a data.frame/tibble object and a variable name as inputs and return a data.frame where the variable has been rescaled.

Create a `rescale_column()` function that accepts two arguments, (1) a data.frame, and (2) the name(s) of the variable(s) to be rescaled. The body of the function should call the original `rescale_01()` function you wrote previously.

::: callout-tip
If you are struggling with this task, I would recommend reading the [Data frame functions](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html#data-frame-functions) section from R4DS.

You might also find [difusing from rlang](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-defuse.html) useful.

Hint: Take a look at the slides from class this week.
:::

```{r}
rescale_column <- function(data, variables){
  
  # Question 7 code
  
}
```

#### 8. Another Function Test

Alright, now let's put your `rescale_column()` function to work! Use your `rescale_column()` function to rescale **both** the `length` and `weight` columns.

::: callout-warning
I expect that you carry out this process by calling the `rescale_column()` function *one* time!
:::

::: callout-tip
I advise against using functions like `mutate_at()`, which have been superseded.
:::

```{r}
# original values
fish |> 
 select(length:weight) |> 
 head()

# rescaled values (code under here)

```
