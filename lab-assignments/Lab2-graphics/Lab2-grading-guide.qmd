# Lab 1: Introduction to Quarto (32 pts)

## 1. Load in data (4pts)

1. use `here()`
2. use `read_csv()`

|  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
| ----| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `read_csv` + `here` |  |  |  |  |

`useherefunc` Make sure you understand how the here() function assists in organizing your workflow!

`useread_csv` The read_csv() function from the readr package (part of the tidyverse).


## 2. Data Description (4pts)

1. dimensions: 30463 x 15

|  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
| ----| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4/4 | missing code for one | missing code for both | 1/4 | 0/4 |

`dimfunc` Using dim() will output the dimensions of the data set (rows x columns) -- e.g., dim(surveys)

`strfunc` The str() function will output a compact display of the structure of an R object, use give.attr = FALSE to remove the attributes -- e.g., str(survyes, give.attr = F)


## 3. Scatterplot (4pts)

x = weight

y = hindfoot_length

geom_point()

`betterggplotformat` Be aware of your code formatting! Putting every layer and aesthetic on a new line will help you follow your parentheses and make the code easier to read!



# 4. Scatterplot: Alpha Blending + Faceting (4pts)

`setalpha` since you are setting the alpha aesthetic, this goes outside of the aes() function and within the geom_xxx() function you want to apply the transparancy to -- e.g. geom_point(alpha = 0.1).

`smalleralpha` The smaller the alpha (between 0 and 1), the more transparency the points or geometric object will have!
  
`usefacetwrap` Using facet_wrap() instead of facet_grid() will help "wrap" the small multiples for each species into multiple rows.

# 4. Scatterplot: Axes Labels (4pts)

`betteraxeslabel`

`missingaxeslabel`

`niceaxeslabel`

`missingaxesunits`

`yasisinsubtitle` To move the y-axes label to the subtitle use labs(subtitle = "Y Axes Label") and either (1) set labs(y = "") empty or (2) theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()).

## 5. Boxplot (4pts)

x = species, y = weight

geom_boxplot()

`sidebysidenotfacet` A side by side box plot is not the same as small multiples; this was clarified in class and posted on the course discord page. We want species on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis with a geom_boxplot().

## 6. Boxplot: geom_jitter() + color + remove outliers (4pts)

geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)

geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, color = "steelblue")

`setalpha`

`smalleralpha`

`setcolor` Recall the difference between setting an aesthetic and assigning/mapping an aesthetic. We want to SET the color -- therefore, color = should be outside of the aes() statement witht the specific color in quotes -- e.g., geom_jitter(color = "blue").

`removeoutlierbxplt` Look up the R documentation with ?geom_boxplot. See what it says about outlier.shape -- this should be outside of any aes() statements and specifically applyied locally to the boxplot geometric object.

## 7. Boxplot: axes labels + orientation

`betteraxeslabel`

`missingaxeslabel`

`niceaxeslabel`

`missingaxesunits`

`doublecheckaxeslabels` When you flipped your axes, make sure you double check your labels align with the correct axes!

`habityasisinsubtitle` It is good to get in the habit of putting your y-axis label into the subtitle of your plot!

`usecoordflip` Another way to flip your axes is to use coord_flip(), but be cautious about what this does with your axes labels!


# Challenge 2: Modifying your Quarto Document (+10 Challenge Points)

## Code Folding

`nocodefold` Add a new line to your YAML header containing *code-fold: true*. Render your .qmd file to see the changes it makes!

## Center Aligned -- pressure

`usehashpipefigalign` There will be slightly different syntax between Rmarkdown (.Rmd) and Quarto (.qmd) files. In Rmarkdown, *{r, fig.align = 'center'}* is included in defining the code chunk. In Quarto however, we want to use that fancy hashpipe *#| fig-align: center* ! This will have an auto-fill feature making code chunk options simple to use. Make sure you are getting in the habit of using the hashpipe code chunk options (disclaimer: you may be already using the hashpipe -- I just can't tell from the output since this part is not shown in the rendered document)

## Figure Caption -- pressure

`c1figcap` It is good practice to give your figures informative captions about what is being displayed. Quarto documents specify this with a hashpipe: *#| fig-cap: "Put your figure caption here."*

## Side-by-side plots -- cars histogram + cars scatterplot

`carsnotsidebyside` Apparently there is a blogpost that says you should be able to place figures side-by-side with 'hold' and fig.width = "50%". This might be a difference between RMarkdown and Quarto code chunk options. When using base R for plotting, *use par(mfrow = c(1,2))* to change the output window layout to have 1 row and 2 columns. You can then change this back using *par(mfrow = c(1,1))*.

## Additional modification

`specifyquartomod` What additional quarto modification did you make? There are a lot of really cool tips and creative features you can modify in quarto documents!
