## The Data {-}

[Download `national_park_trails.csv`](national_park_trails.csv)

The data set for this exam concerns hiking trails in America’s National Parks system. Data is taken from the AllTrails app, which allows users to input new trails and rate existing ones. You can find documentation on the data set from its creator [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/planejane/national-park-trails).

Variables in the data are:

+ `trail_id:` An ID number for the trail
+ `name:` Name of the trail
+ `area_name:` National Park where the trial is located
+ `city_name:` City where the trail is located
+ `state_name:` State where the trail is located
+ `country_name:` Country where the trail is located
+ `_geoloc:` Latitude and longitude of trail
+ `popularity:` A score from 0 to 100 of how often the trail is used.
+ `length:` Distance covered by trail (in meters).
+ `elevation_gain:` How much uphill is on the trail (in meters).
+ `difficulty_rating:` Average user rating of trail difficulty
+ `route_type:` Type of trail (loop, out and back, or point to point)
+ `visitor_usage:` (Honestly, I’m not sure what this one is.)
+ `avg_rating:` The average visitor rating of the trail (1 to 5 stars)
+ `num_reviews:` The total number of reviews on the app for that trail
+ `features:` Notable elements about the trail
+ `activities:` Common uses for the trail
+ `units:` This variable is a lie! All the lengths are in meters.

You may bring to the exam any pre-analysis you have done of this data.

## General Questions  [25 points]

You will be asked a series of ten questions about performing operations with the `tidyverse`, simulating data, plotting, etc. These will be multiple choice, fill in the blank, matching, and select all that apply style.

## Short Answer [50 points]

You will be given a `.qmd` template and asked a series of short questions about the national park data set, such as "Which word was most and least familiar to participants under 20 years old?" 

There will be at least one "write a `function`" question and at least one "`map`" question.

::: callout-warning
Each of these questions should be answered using one pipeline from the `tidyverse`. It should not take you more than 5-6 lines of code per question.

The "one" pipeline rule holds for the body of the function and the entirety of the map question.
:::

::: callout-note
You will turn in your `.html` and `.qmd` files, but only your `.html` file will be graded. You will be graded on the correct output, as well as your code style, workflow, and design.
:::

## Statistical Modeling [25 points]

You will be given a `.qmd` template and asked to conduct a statistical analysis on the national park data set to answer a question. You will be asked to interpret the results of your model.
