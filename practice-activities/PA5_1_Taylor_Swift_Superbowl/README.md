# Stats331_PA_Taylor_Swift_Superbowl
The following repo is of a practice activity I designed to help students get familiar with the <a href = https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/> Lubridate </a> library in R.

The dataset is collected using the <a href = https://serpapi.com/google-flights-api> Serpapi Google Flights API </a> but has been subsetted and cleaned up to be more relevant for this assignment.


# Background

Taylor Swift, one of the world's most popular pop singers, has just been invited to sing at the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, Taylor has a very tight schedule with a concert in Tokyo Japan the night before, and her private jet has a technical issue, so she could not use it to bring her to Vegas.  She contacted you knowing that you are an expert flight tracker and data analyst in helping her find a route to attend the event so she would not disappoint her fans. You quickly query the GDS (the underlying database powering nearly all modern flight booking websites) which returns the following CSV file of all the available flights between Tokyo and Vegas for the Super Bowl weekend.  
Use the following dataset and your knowledge of R data manipulation to find the shortest route for Taylor to take from her Tokyo concert to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas Nevada.
