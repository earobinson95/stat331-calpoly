## Same Data, Different Formats

Different formats of the data are **tidy** in different ways.

```{r tidy-data}
#| echo: false
bb_tidy_data <- tibble(Team     = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                       Points   = c(88, 91, 99, 94),
                       Assists  = c(12, 17, 24, 28),
                       Rebounds = c(22, 28, 30, 31)
                       )
```

::: panel-tabset
### Option 1

```{r}
#| echo: false
bb_tidy_data |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

### Option 2

```{r}
#| echo: false
bb_tidy_data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols      = c(Points, Assists, Rebounds),
               names_to  = "Statistic",
               values_to = "Value"
               ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

# Working with External Data


## Common Types of Data Files

Look at the **file extension** for the type of data file.

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

`.csv` :  "comma-separated values"

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
```
Name, Age
Bob, 49
Joe, 40
```
:::

::::

. . .

`.xls, .xlsx`:  Microsoft Excel spreadsheet

  + Common approach: save as `.csv`
  + Nicer approach:  use the `readxl` package

. . .

`.txt`:  plain text

  + Could have any sort of delimiter...
  + Need to let R know what to look for!


## Common Types of Data Files

::: panel-tabset
### File A

![](images/csv_file.png)

### File B

![](images/tsv_file.png)

### File C

![](images/pipe_file.png)

### Sources

+ [File A](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html)
+ [File B](https://github.com/ccusa/Disaster_Vulnerability_Map/blob/master/sample-data.tsv)
+ [File C](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/24/quick-parse-csv-file.html)

:::


## Loading External Data

Using **base** `R` functions:

- `read.csv()` is for reading in `.csv` files.

- `read.table()` and `read.delim()` are for any data with "columns" (you specify the separator).


## Loading External Data

The **tidyverse** has some cleaned-up versions in the `readr` and `readxl` packages: 

- `read_csv()` is for comma-separated data.

- `read_tsv()` is for tab-separated data.

- `read_table()` is for white-space-separated data.

- `read_delim()` is any data with "columns" (you specify the separator). The above are special cases.

- `read_excel()` is specifically for dealing with Excel files.

Remember to load the `readr` and `readxl` packages first!

# Grammar of Graphics


## Grammar of Graphics

The Grammar of Graphics (GoG) is a principled way of specifying **exactly** how to create a particular graph from a given data set. It helps us to systematically design new graphs.

. . .

<br>

Think of a graph or a data visualization as a mapping...

...**FROM variables** in the data set (or statistics computed from the data)...

...**TO visual attributes** (or "aesthetics") **of marks** (or "geometric elements") on the page/screen.


## Why Grammar of Graphics?

+ It's more flexible than a "chart zoo" of named graphs.
+ The software understands the structure of your graph.
+ It easily automates graphing of data subsets.
  
. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
## *ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis* by Hadley Wickham
The grammar makes it easier for you to iteratively update a plot, changing a single feature at a time. The grammar is also useful because it suggests the high-level aspects of a plot that *can* be changed, giving you a framework to think about graphics, and hopefully shortening the distance from mind to paper. It also encourages the use of graphics customised to a particular problem, rather than relying on specific chart types.
:::


## Components of Grammar of Graphics

+ `data`: dataframe containing variables
+ `aes` : aesthetic mappings (position, color, symbol, ...)
+ `geom` : geometric element (point, line, bar, box, ...)
+ `stat` : statistical variable transformation (identity, count, linear model, quantile, ...)
+ `scale` : scale transformation (log scale, color mapping, axes tick breaks, ...)
+ `coord` : Cartesian, polar, map projection, ...
+ `facet` : divide into subplots using a categorical variable


# Using `ggplot2`


## How to Build a Graphic

Complete this template to build a basic graphic:

<br>

![](images/basic_ggplot.png)

+ We use `+` to add **layers** to a graphic.


##

::: panel-tabset

### Add data

This begins a plot that you can add layers to:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-width: 4.5
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

### Add aesthetics

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-width: 4.5
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       aes(x = class, y = hwy)
       )
```

### Add one `geom` per layer

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
#| fig-height: 6
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       aes(x = class, y = hwy)
       ) +
  geom_jitter()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
#| fig-height: 6
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       aes(x = class, y = hwy)
       ) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot()
```

:::

How would you make the points be **on top** of the boxplots?

::::
:::

## Aesthetics

We map **variables** (columns) from the data to **aesthetics** on the graphic useing the `aes()` function.

. . .

What aesthetics can we set (*see [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) for more*)?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="22%"}

<font size = "6">

+ color, fill
+ linetype
+ lineend
+ size
+ shape

</font>

**Global Aesthetics**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2-3"
ggplot(data = housingsub, 
       mapping = aes(x = date, 
                     y = median)
       ) +
  geom_point()
```

**Local Aesthetics**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2-3"
ggplot(data = housingsub) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, 
                           y = median)
             )
```

:::

**Mapping Aesthetics**

```{r}
#| eval: false

#| code-line-numbers: "4"
ggplot(data = housingsub) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, 
                           y = median,
                           color = city)
             )
```

**Setting Aesthetics**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
ggplot(data = housingsub) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, 
                           y = median), 
             color = "blue"
               )
```

## Geometric Objects

Wee use a `geom_xxx()` function to represent data points.

. . .

:::: {.columns}

<font size = "6">

::: {.column width="35%"}
**one variable**

+ `geom_density()`
+ `geom_dotplot()`

### geom_point()

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = cty,
           y = hwy,

  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 14))
```

### geom_text()

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-align: center

  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 14))
```

## Creating a Graphic

To create a specific type of graphic, we will **combine** aesthetics and geometric objects.

. . .

<br>

Let's try it!


##

::: panel-tabset

### The Goal

Start with the TX housing data.

![](images/tx_housing.png)

Make a plot of <span style="color:teal"> median house price </span> over <span style="color:purple"> time </span> (including both <span style="color:green"> individual data points </span> and <span style="color:darkorange"> a smoothed trend line </span>), distinguishing between <span style="color:blue"> different cities </span>.


### Game Plan

![](images/txhousing_plan.png)

### ggplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = txhousing, aes(x = date, y = median, color = city)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Median Home Price",
       title = "Texas Housing Prices")
```

:::


## Statistical Transformation: `stat`

A `stat` transforms an existing variable into a new variable to plot.

+ `identity` leaves the data as is.
+ `count` counts the number of observations.
+ `summary` allows you to specify a desired transformation function.

. . .

Sometimes these statistical transformations happen under the hood when we call a `geom`.




## Statistical Transformation: `stat`

::: panel-tabset

### `stat_count()`

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = class)) +
  stat_count(geom = "bar")
```

:::
::::

### `stat_summary()`

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4-5"
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = class,
                     y = hwy)) +
  stat_summary(geom = "bar",
               fun = "mean") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,45))
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4-5"
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = class,
                     y = hwy)) +
  stat_summary(geom = "bar",
               fun = "max") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,45))
```

:::
::::
:::

## Faceting

Extracts subsets of data and places them in side-by-side graphics.

::: panel-tabset

### `facet_grid()`
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 2
#| fig-width: 12
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(.~class)
```

### Options
<font size = "6">

+ `facet_grid(. ~ b)`: facet into columns based on b
+ `facet_grid(a ~ .)`: facet into rows based on a
+ `facet_grid(a ~ b)`: facet into both rows and columns
+ `facet_wrap( ~ b)`: wrap facets into a rectangular layout

</font>

### Scales
You can set scales to let axis limits vary across facets:

`facet_grid(y ~ x, scales = ______)`

<font size = "6">

  + `"free"` -- both x- and y-axis limits adjust to individual facets
  + `"free_x"` -- only x-axis limits adjust
  + `"free_y"` -- only y-axis limits adjust

</font>

### Labels
You can set a labeller to adjust facet labels:

<font size = "6">

+ `facet_grid(. ~ fl, labeller = label_both)`
+ `facet_grid(. ~ fl, labeller = label_bquote(alpha ^ .(x)))`
+ `facet_grid(. ~ fl, labeller = label_parsed)`

</font>
:::


## Position Adjustements

Position adjustments determine how to arrange `geom`'s that would otherwise occupy the same space.

<font size = "6">

+ `position = 'dodge'`: Arrange elements side by side.
+ `position = 'fill'`: Stack elements on top of one another + normalize height.
+ `position = 'stack'`: Stack elements on top of one another.
+ `position = 'jitter"`: Add random noise to X & Y position of each element to avoid overplotting (see `geom_jitter()`).
 </font>


## Position Adjustements

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(mpg, aes(fl, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "")`
```

## Plot Customizations

::: panel-tabset

### Labels

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3-6"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(x = "Engine Displacement (liters)", 
       y = "Highway MPG", 
       color = "Number of \nCylinders",
       title = "Car Efficiency")
```

### Themes
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "7-8"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(xlab = "Engine Displacement (liters)", 
       ylab = "Highway MPG", 
       color = "Number of \nCylinders",
       title = "Car Efficiency") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Scales: Axes Ticks
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6-9"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(x     = "Engine Displacement (liters)",
       color = "Number of \nCylinders",
       title = "Car Efficiency") +
  scale_y_continuous("Highway MPG", 
                     limits = c(0,50),
                     breaks = seq(0,50,5)
                     )
```

### Scales: Color
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "7"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(x    = "Engine Displacement (liters)",
       y    = "Highway MPG",
       color = "Number of \nCylinders",
       title = "Car Efficiency") +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "white", high = "green4")
```
:::


## Formatting your Plot Code

It is good practice to put each `geom` and `aes` on a new line.

+ This makes code easier to read! 
+ Generally: no line of code should be over 80 characters long.

::: panel-tabset
### Bad Practice

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + labs(x = "City (mpg)", y = "Highway (mpg)")
```

### Good Practice

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = cty, 
                     y = hwy, 
                     color = class)
       ) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "City (mpg)", 
       y = "Highway (mpg)"
       )
```

### Somewhere In bBetween

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)
       ) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "City (mpg)", y = "Highway (mpg)")
```

:::


## Let's Practice!

How would you make this plot from the `diamonds` dataset in `ggplot2`?


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
tmp <- diamonds
tmp$category <- cut(tmp$price, breaks = c(0, 999, 4999, Inf))
price_labs <- c("<$1k", "$1k-$5k", ">$5k")
names(price_labs) <- c("(0,999]","(999,5e+03]","(5e+03,Inf]")

ggplot(data = tmp,
       mapping = aes(x = cut,
                     fill = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(.~category,
             labeller = labeller(category = price_labs)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 14),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 18))
```

:::
::: {.column width="10%"}

<br>

+ `data`
+ `aes`
+ `geom`
+ `facet`

## Creating a Game Plan

There are a lot of pieces to put together when creating a good graphic.

+ So, when sitting down to create a plot, you should first create a **game plan**!

. . .

This game plan should include:

1. What data are you starting from?
2. What are your x- and y-axes?
3. What type(s) of `geom` do you need?
4. What other `aes`'s do you need?


##

::: panel-tabset

### Make a Game Plan!

Use the `mpg` dataset to create two side-by-side scatterplots of city MPG vs. highway MPG where the points are colored by the drive type (drv). The two ploits should be separated by year.

![](images/empty_game_plan.png)

### Example

![](images/mpg_game_plan.png)

### R Code

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 4.5
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = cty,
                     y = hwy,
                     color = drv)
       ) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(.~year) +
  labs(x = "city MPG",
       y = "highway MPG")+
  scale_color_discrete(name = "drive type",
                      labels = c("4-wheel","front","rear"))
```

## Wednesday, April 12

Today we will...

+ Course Updates
+ New Material
  + What makes a good graphic?
+ Lab 2: Exploring Rodents with ggplot2
+ Challenge 2: Spicing things up with ggplot2


## A Couple of Updates

After experiencing the first week and a half of classes:

1. Check-ins will be due Mondays at **10:00am** (instead of 8:00am).
  + I will hope to release Canvas check-in quizzes by noon on Thursdays, so you are not required to work over the weekend.
2. Practice activities will be due Wednesday at **10:00am** (instead of 8:00am).

## A Couple of Updates

After experiencing the first week and a half of classes:

3. I will post skeleton rubrics for lab activities on Canvas (on Thursdays) to share the general structure of how you will be graded.
  + Grading will be on a scale of *Master* to *Practitioner* to *Novice* to *No Effort*.
  + If you make a meaningful error in your code, you cannot earn *Master* for that question.
  + Your labs **will** have an appearance/workflow/code format portion. Check out the [guidelines](https://canvas.calpoly.edu/courses/98835/pages/lab-appearance-workflow-and-code-format).
  

## Graphics

Graphics consist of:

+ **Structure:** boxplot, scatterplot, etc.

+ **Aesthetics:** features such as color, shape, and size that map other variables to structural features.

**Both** the structure and aesthetics should help viewers interpret the information.


## What makes bad graphics bad?

+ BAD DATA.
+ Too much "chartjunk" -- superfluous details (Tufte).
+ Design choices that are difficult for the human brain to process, including:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="10%"}

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

  + Colors
  + Orientation
  + Organization

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

## What makes good graphics good?

Edward R. Tufte is a well-known critic of visualizations, and his definition of **graphical excellence** consists of:

  + communicating complex ideas with **clarity, precision, and efficiency**.
  + maximizing the **data-to-ink** ratio.
  + using multivariate displays.
  + telling the truth about the data.


## Graphics

When creating graphics, we need to think carefully about how we make structure and aesthetic decisions.


# Gestalt Principles


## Gestalt Principles

Our brains have an amazing ability to create and perceive structure among visual objects.

+ This is commonly referred to as the Gestalt principles of visual perception.
+ This framework can help us think about how to create the most expressive and effective data visualizations:


## Gestalt Principles

::: panel-tabset

### Similarity

Objects with the **same visual properties** are assumed to be similar and are grouped together.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}

<br>

Use design elements such as **shape and color** to indicate groupings of the data.
:::
::: {.column width="35%"}

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/similarity.png")
```

:::
::::

### Proximity

Objects that are **close together** are perceived as a group.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Since physical distance connotes similarity, grouping bars on a chart can indicate similarities among their data.

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/proximity.png")
```

:::
::::
### Continuity

Elements that are **aligned** (on the same line, curve, or plane) are perceived to be more closely related to each other than to other elements.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

It is often easier for us to perceive the groupings if the shapes are curves, rather than lines with sharp edges.

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/continuity.png")
```

:::
::::
  

### Enclosure

Objects that appear to have a **boundary around them** are perceived as being related.

  + Add line boundaries or shading to group objects.

### Connection

Objects that are **connected**, such as by a line, are perceived as a group.

  + Connect data together to indicate a relationship.
  + This connectedness is highly effective and often overrides other principles for group perception.
  + Every line plot is an example of connectedness.
  
### Closure

Complex arrangements of visual elements are perceived as a **single, recognizable pattern**.

```{r}
#| out-width: 25%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/closure.png")
```

### Figure and Ground

Objects are perceived as either standing out prominently in the **foreground** of an image or receding into the **background**.

  + Shading or color blocking can be employed to distinguish between the more important figure and less important ground features of an image.
  + Place elements of the most importance in the foreground figure.
  
### Focal Point

Whatever **stands out visually** is perceived as the most important. It will grab our attention first and hold it for the longest.

  + Use design elements selectively to draw attention to the most important features of the data.

## Gestalt Principles

Gestalt Hierarchy	| Graphical Feature
------------------| ------------------
1. Enclosure	    | Facets
2. Connection     |	Lines
3. Proximitiy	    | White Space
4. Similarity	    | Color/Shape

. . .

Implications for practice:

+ Know that we perceive some groups before others.
+ Design to facilitate and emphasize the most important comparisons.

# Pre-attentive Features

Raise your hand when you notice it.

## Pre-attentive Features

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png")
```

## Pre-attentive Features

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png")
```

## Pre-attentive Features

**Pre-attentive features** are features that we see and perceive before we even think about it.

+ They will jump out at us in less than 250 ms.

+ E.g., color, form, movement, spatial location.

There is a **hierarchy** of features:

+ Color is stronger than shape.
+ Combinations of pre-attentive features may **not** be pre-attentive due to interference.


## Double Encoding
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png")
```

## No Double Encoding
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png")
```

# Color

## Color

+ Use color to your advantage!
  + Color, hue, and intensity are pre-attentive, where bigger contrasts lead to faster detection.
  + **Hue**: main color family (red, orange, yellow...)
  + **Intensity**: amount of color

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}

```{r}
#| out-width: 90%
knitr::include_graphics("images/hue.png")
```

:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intensity.png")
```

## Color Guidelines

+ Use mappings from data to color that are numerically and perceptually uniform.
+ Be conscious of what certain colors “mean”.
+ Do not use rainbow color gradients.
+ Avoid using green-yellow-red color schemes -- you might have color-blind audience members!

## Color Guidelines

+ To colorblind-proof a graphic, try:
  + **double encoding** - when you use color, **also** use another aesthetic (line type, shape, etc.).
  + using a **monochromatic** color gradient.
    + If you have a bidirectional scale (e.g., showing + and - values), use purple-white-orange. Always transition through white!
  + printing your chart out in black and white -- if you can still read it, it will be safe for colorblind users.


## Gradients

::: panel-tabset

### Qualitative schemes

Usually no more than 7 colors:

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png")
```

Can use `colorRampPalette()` from the `RColorBrewer` package to produce larger palettes by interpolating existing ones

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png")
```


### Quantitative schemes

Use color gradient with only one hue for positive values:

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/blues.png")
```

Use color gradient with two hues for positive and negative values. Gradient should go through a light, neutral color (white).

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/PuOr.png")
```

## Color in ggplot2

There are several packages with color scheme options:

+ Rcolorbrewer
+ ggsci
+ viridis
+ wesanderson

These packages have color palettes hthatare aesthetically pleasing and, in many cases, colorblind friendly.

You can also take a look at other [ways to find nice color palettes](https://lisacharlottemuth.com/2016/04/22/Colors-for-DataVis/).
