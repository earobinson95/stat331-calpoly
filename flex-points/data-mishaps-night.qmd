## Challenge Points (up to +9)
+ Submit to canvas a "hardy" and "clear" reflection for each of the keynote and/or theme sessions you attend.
  + This can be in paragraph form or some sort of creative "sketch" format.
  + Should be much more insightful than *"They left their usb drive on the subway. That's rough."*.
+ Each "reflection" gets you +3 challenge points (that is up to +9 for the whole night!)
+ Turn in one document for all session reflections
  + Make sure to indicate with a header, which theme your reflection is for. 
  + You can write/sketch this in any document editor of your choosing (Word, Quarto, Google Docs, Excalidraw, etc.)
