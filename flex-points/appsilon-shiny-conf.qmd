Each spring, Appsilon Shiny hosts a conference showcasing new developments and applications of R Shiny. Unfortunately, this spring, it is in April after the end of our quarter. You can watch recordings from past conference talks at <https://www.youtube.com/@appsilon_official/playlists>. There are three playlists associated with past conferences:

+ *2023 Shiny Conf* - Shiny App Showcases: short videos showcasing applications
+ *ShinyConf 2023* - Videos about developments in R Shiny
+ *2022 Appsilon Shiny Conference* - Videos from the 2022 conference; includes both series of showcases and developments (you may even find Dr. Robinson's talk in here!)

::: callout-tip
You may want to look through (`CTRL` + `F`) the playlists for some of the "KEYNOTES" -- for example, [Keynote, Filip Stachura: Transforming Business with Open Source: Insights from the Pharma Industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHkriKBlNws&list=PLexAKolMzPcriOdeLwoMxQOyHRnMguEv4&index=5) or general talks 
such as the [R-Ladies Panel discussion: Women in Shiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSwSy0jd4g0&list=PLexAKolMzPcrYjGA1PULfm7-P12qjKmPb&index=8)

You may wish to try your hand at creating a Shiny app of your own! `r emoji::emoji("bubble")` I wonder if this would make a good FP opportunity. Want to suggest it?!

## Flex Points: Video Reflections (up to +15)
+ Submit to canvas a "hardy" and "clear" reflection for each video you watch.
  + This can be in paragraph form or some sort of creative "sketch" format.
  + What did you learn? How does this relate to your current or future experiences?
  + Make sure to include the title and link to the video in your reflection!
+ Each "reflection" gets you up to +3 FP
+ Turn in one document for all session reflections
  + Make sure to indicate with a header, which talk you attended.
  + You can write/sketch this in any document editor of your choosing (Word, Quarto, Google Docs, Excalidraw, etc.)
+ You can submit reflections for up to **5 talks/videos**.
  + Please make sure to indicate how many videos you watched.
  
**Due Friday, March 1st at 11:59pm**
